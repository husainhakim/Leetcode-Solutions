## Introduction

This repository serves as a personal archive of my LeetCode solutions. Each solution is organized by problem difficulty and category. Whether you're a fellow coder looking for insights or just curious about my coding journey, feel free to explore the repository.

## Structure

The repository is structured to make navigation easy:

- **`easy/`**: Contains solutions to easy-level problems.
- **`medium/`**: Contains solutions to medium-level problems.
- **`hard/`**: Contains solutions to hard-level problems.

Each file is named after the problem it solves, with a brief comment at the top explaining the solution approach.

## How to Use

To use the solutions in this repository:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-sync.git
